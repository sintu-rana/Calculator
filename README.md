# Project Overview:
The following features should be considered as “must haves” for this app:-
1.It must have an equation line (screen) to display the mathematical equation and the result.
2.It must have buttons which must represent numerical values or mathematical operations, and be clickable.
3.It must have the mathematical operations functionality (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
4.It must perform mathematical calculations and return the result (=) as well as clear the equation line (c).

# Conclusion:-
In this article we covered how you can create a custom basic GUI calculator in Python using tkinter library.
